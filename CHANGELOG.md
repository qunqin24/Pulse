# Changelog

What each release changed, written for somebody deciding whether to install it.

This file is the source for both the GitHub release page and the text Sparkle
shows in the update window — see [Scripts/changelog.py](Scripts/changelog.py).
Add the entry **before** tagging, in the small grammar the converter knows:
bullets, `**bold**`, `` `code` `` and `[links](https://example.com)`.

## 1.0.6

- **Grok**, read from the login Grok Build's CLI already stores — nothing to paste. One thing worth knowing before the ring confuses you: since June 2026 a paid Grok plan spends **one weekly pool across every Grok product** — the web chat, Imagine, voice, the API and the CLI alike — so this is what the account has spent this week, not what the CLI has. That is why it is called Grok rather than Grok Build.
- **Grok Bot**, which is a different limit despite the name. It comes with a Cursor plan rather than a SuperGrok one, so it is read with the login the Cursor editor already stores and carries the xAI mark to tell the two apart on the rail. It appears by itself only if the standalone app is installed; otherwise switch it on in Settings.
- **A second account of either.** Grok signs in with a device code, Grok Bot through Cursor's own sign-in page. Both ask for the narrowest access that can read a limit — never for permission to read or write your conversations.
- A card could print a window length the provider never reported. Some limits carry a length that only exists to sort the rows — a rolling week, a billing cycle — and when there was no reset time to show, that length was printed as though it were one.
- A provider with a single route named the wrong one in Settings. Every such provider but Cursor was described as "Antigravity's language server", about an app it had nothing to do with.

## 1.0.5

- **Claude Code read through the Claude desktop app.** If you work in the desktop app rather than a terminal, Pulse had no way to see your limits: the desktop app hands the CLI a token through its own environment and renews it itself, so the login Pulse was reading went stale and never came back, and it never renders a status line either. Pulse can now read the session the desktop app is signed in with — a new "Desktop app" choice under Read usage from, and the route `Automatic` falls back to once you have allowed it. It asks for the keychain once, at launch, so there is nothing to go and find in Settings.
- **The new route says why it can't answer**, rather than leaving the last reading in place with nothing but its "Last read" time to give it away — which is what makes a refresh look as though it did nothing. It says whether the desktop app is signed out, or whether it was the keychain that was refused.
- **A reading could go backwards.** A newer figure already on file could be replaced on screen by an older one that had just arrived, and a refresh that had been given up on could still overwrite the one that replaced it — including, for an added account, the renewed login itself.
- **GitHub Copilot no longer shows a red ring for paid overage.** Going past the included allowance with overage permitted is not being blocked, and it was being drawn as though it were.
- **Codex no longer marks the wrong model group as spent.** A group reporting "limit reached" could put the mark on another group's window entirely.
- Removing your only added account no longer leaves the rail empty.

## 1.0.4

- **GitHub Copilot**, bringing it to twelve. Signs in with a device code, so there is no token to paste — Pulse asks GitHub for permission to read your profile and nothing else, and never for access to your repositories. Shows the completions, chat and premium-request allowances your plan actually has.
- **Whether a limit will last.** A switch in Settings puts one line under each limit on the card: whether it is on course to outlast its window, and roughly when it runs out if it isn't. Off by default, and it stays quiet when the figures can't carry it — the time only appears when it falls before the reset, and it is rounded, because usage comes in bursts and a figure to the minute would be made up.
- **Show what's left instead of what's spent.** Another switch, which turns the figure and the ring over together so a limit reads "88% left" rather than "12% used". The colour still means how close you are, so a nearly empty ring is still red.
- **Claude Code's card names the plan** — "Max 5x", "Pro", "Team" — as every other provider's already did. The multiplier is part of it, since a Max 5x and a Max 20x are different products.
- **The panel could quietly stop refreshing** after running a long time, and only come back when you next started Claude Code in a terminal. It notices when its own readings have gone stale and asks again, recovers from a fetch that never returned, and refreshes when the Mac wakes as well as when the display does.

## 1.0.3

- **The panel can go on a second display.** Drag it across; it remembers which screen you left it on, and comes home if that screen is unplugged.
- **Four more providers**: the GLM Coding Plan and MiniMax, each with a separate entry for the international and the mainland service, since they are separate accounts with separate keys.
- **A second arc can show how far through the window the clock is**, so "80% used" can be read against how much of the window is left. Off by default, in Settings.
- **The figure can sit above the ring** instead of below it. Also in Settings.
- A provider that needs an API key is no longer switched on by itself — it waits in Settings rather than taking a place on the rail to ask for a key.
- One that has no key says so, instead of saying "Reading…" for ever.
- Claude Code no longer shows a limit that has already reset. If its saved login has expired and no session has run for a while, the stale window is dropped rather than shown with an old reset time.
- The update window now shows the release notes itself, rather than loading the GitHub page inside it.

## 1.0.2

- **Multiple accounts.** Sign in to a second Claude Code or Codex subscription and watch both at once, each with its own ring.
- **Cursor**, reported as the two pools its own account page shows.
- **Ollama Cloud**, from PcOffeeP's pull request — with the session read out of your browser rather than copied by hand.
- **The rail can dock along the top of the screen**, above the menu bar.
- **A colour of your own for any ring**, and the gap between rings is now adjustable.
- **Percentages can be switched off** on either rail.
- The rail opens with the last reading instead of sitting blank.
- The activity mark no longer keeps turning for a minute after a turn has ended.
- The API-key field in Settings lets go when you click away from it.
- A limit you have used never reads as 0% any more.
- Quitting Codex no longer takes Pulse down with it.
- A new app icon, drawn on Apple's icon grid.

## 1.0.1

- **OpenCode Go** and **Kimi Code**, bringing it to five agents.
- **Put the rings in your own order**, in Settings.
- **A refresh button on every provider's pane**, with the age of the reading beside it.
- A new install starts with the agents you actually have, rather than five rings that say "not configured".
- The panel can be dragged by any part of the capsule, not only by its rings.
- Clicking a ring refreshes the one you clicked, whatever order the rail is in.
- The detail card no longer truncates itself at Small or sit half empty at Large.

## 1.0.0

- The first release. A floating rail of rings against the edge of the screen, one per coding agent, showing how much of each limit is left.
